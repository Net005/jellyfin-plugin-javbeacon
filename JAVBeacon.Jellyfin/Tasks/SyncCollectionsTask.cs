/// a JAVBeacon outage during the interval, the plugin being reloaded, etc.)
/// has no other safety net. This task runs the exact same full reconcile
/// pass on demand ("Run Now" in Jellyfin's Scheduled Tasks page) and on its
/// own default schedule, independent of whether the background loop happens
/// to be behind, so a missed realtime update is always eventually caught up.
